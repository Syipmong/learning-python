Week 4 - Exercise 1: Student Grade Manager
Learn list creation, indexing, and basic operations through a grade management system.

Learning Goals:
- Create and manipulate lists
- Use indexing and slicing
- Perform basic list operations
- Handle user input validation

Tasks:
1. Create a program that manages student grades
2. Allow adding grades to the list
3. Calculate average, highest, and lowest grades
4. Display grades in various formats
5. Remove specific grades
6. Find grades above/below certain thresholds
