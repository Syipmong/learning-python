# Exercise 4: String Formatting and Operations
# TODO: Complete the following string manipulation tasks

# 1. Create variables for first name and last name
first_name = ""  # Replace with your first name
last_name = ""   # Replace with your last name

# 2. Create a full name by combining first and last name
full_name = ""  # Use string concatenation or f-strings

# 3. Convert the full name to different cases
full_name_upper = ""    # All uppercase
full_name_lower = ""    # All lowercase
full_name_title = ""    # Title case

# 4. Create a formatted introduction
# Example: "Hello, my name is JOHN DOE, but you can call me john."
introduction = ""

# 5. Count the number of characters in your full name (excluding spaces)
char_count = 0

# 6. Check if your name contains the letter 'a' (case insensitive)
contains_a = False

# 7. Replace all spaces in your full name with underscores
name_with_underscores = ""

# 8. Create a username by taking first 3 letters of first name and last 3 of last name
username = ""

# Print all results
print("=== String Operations Results ===")
print(f"Full name: {full_name}")
print(f"Uppercase: {full_name_upper}")
print(f"Lowercase: {full_name_lower}")
