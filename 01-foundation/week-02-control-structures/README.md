# Week 2: Control Structures

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control program flow
- Implement loops (for, while) for repetitive tasks
- Use break and continue statements effectively
- Handle basic errors with try/except

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Conditional Statements
- if statements
- if-else statements
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- **Practice**: Age category classifier

### Day 2: Multiple Conditions
- elif statements
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested if statements
- **Practice**: Grade calculator

### Day 3: For Loops
- Basic for loop syntax
- Looping through ranges
- Looping through strings
- **Practice**: Pattern printer

### Day 4: While Loops
- While loop syntax
- Loop control with break and continue
- Infinite loops and how to avoid them
- **Practice**: Number guessing game

### Day 5: Error Handling Basics
- Understanding common errors
- try/except blocks
- Handling specific exceptions
- **Practice**: Robust calculator

### Weekend Project: Interactive Menu System
Create a program with a menu that allows users to choose different operations.

## Key Concepts
- **Conditional Logic**: Making decisions in code
- **Iteration**: Repeating code blocks
- **Flow Control**: Directing program execution
- **Error Prevention**: Handling unexpected inputs

## Common Patterns
```python
# Conditional pattern
if condition:
    # do something
elif other_condition:
    # do something else
else:
    # default action

# Loop patterns
for item in sequence:
    # process item

while condition:
    # repeat until condition is false
```

## Assessment
- [ ] Can write complex conditional statements
- [ ] Understands when to use for vs while loops
- [ ] Can use break and continue appropriately
- [ ] Handles basic exceptions
- [ ] Completed the weekend project
