# Exercise 4: Number Guessing Game
# TODO: Create a number guessing game using while loops

import random

print("=== Number Guessing Game ===")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100!")

# TODO: Generate a random number between 1 and 100
secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)

# TODO: Implement the game logic:
# - Keep asking for guesses until correct
# - Track number of attempts
# - Provide hints (too high/too low)
# - Handle invalid input

# TODO: Features to implement:
# - Maximum number of attempts (e.g., 7)
# - Play again option
# - Score tracking
